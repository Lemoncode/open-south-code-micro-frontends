# Client Side Integration Web Components

* Catalog
* Sellers
* Users

We have three different teams, each of these teams have its own sub domain, catalog manages the current stock, sellers manages every thing that is related with providers and users manages the user inside the application. 

From users we are retrieving the welcome panel.
From sellers we are using a button that will tell us the number of items on stock. The implemnetation is not real, is just a mock.

> Exercise: Display the available items on catalog, after user has click on `Available` button.
